Conference season started early this year! Part of the Latvis Lab traveled to Baton Rouge, LA, for the [Society of Systematic Biology](https://www.systbio.org/)'s standalone conference. It was a great opportunity to discuss the importance of biological collections (museums and herbaria) for scientific research, systematics, and biodiversity conservation.
Rachel and Chucks (members of the Latvis Lab) gave great lightning talks about their research on parasitic plants' evolution and systematics. I also had the chance to meet amazing people from many different places (including many Brazilians!) and to enjoy Louisiana’s great food, architecture, and culture.
The LSU campus is beautiful, home to a natural history museum and an herbarium with an amazing biodiversity collections from all over the world.
It was such a great way to start the year. Thank you for a great conference, SSB!
