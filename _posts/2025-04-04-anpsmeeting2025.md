We, the plant people from UofA, took the herbarium van down to Monticello, AR, this past weekend to attend the Arkansas Native Plant Society! We had the chance to learn about diseases affecting the loblolly pine, enjoy fantastic talks from students who received ANPS grants last year, and join several field trips to explore the amazing plant biodiversity in that part of the state. Huge congratulations to this incredible society that truly makes a difference in advancing the study of botany in Arkansas. Also, I bought a really cute hat to support the society! ☺️
