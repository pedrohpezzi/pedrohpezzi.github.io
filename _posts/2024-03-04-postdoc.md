Great news! I've just relocated to Fayetteville, Arkansas, to start a postdoctoral position at [Maribeth Latvis](https://maribethlatvis.wixsite.com/plantsyst)'s lab at the University of Arkansas. We will focus on the South American *Agalinis* species, an intriguing system as they migrated from North America to South America, where they underwent two rapid radiations‚Äîone in the Andean region and another in Brazil‚Äîand hummingbird pollination evolved at least twice. During my time in Brazil, I had the opportunity to observe *A. communis* in its natural habitat, which happened to be on my old campus! I'm thrilled to start this new chapter of my academic journey and grateful for the warm welcome by the team at the Latvis lab! Go Razorbacks! üêó
