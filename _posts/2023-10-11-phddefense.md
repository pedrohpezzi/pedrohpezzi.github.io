There's nothing better than starting my posts here (although I'm a few months late, haha ðŸ¤­) by saying that I successfully defended my [dissertation](/files/PezziDissertation2023.pdf)! After 4.5 years of hard work, I completed my thesis with five chapters covering several aspects of hybridization in the diversification process of *Petunia*. It was truly special to share this moment with my family, friends, and the members of the committee: Prof. Dr. Clarisse Palma-Silva, Dr. Alexandre Rizzo Zuntini (who actually encouraged me to create this website!), and Prof. Dr. Nelson Fagundes. Here are some photos from the celebration! A special thanks to my advisor Prof. Dr. Loreta B. Freitas, and everyone who has been part of this journey! ðŸ’–
