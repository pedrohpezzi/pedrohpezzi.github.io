Botany is one of the most fun conferences Iâ€™ve attended, full of great people and amazing science! I also loved Palm Springs. Being in the desert and seeing all the unique biodiversity was amazing. It took me back to my undergrad days when I was a visiting student at Cal State Fullerton.

This year, I had the opportunity to present the first product of my postdoc at the University of Arkansas. We are currently investigating the biogeographic patterns of *Agalinis* and how hummingbird pollination and a perennial life strategy have impacted the diversification of South American species. The manuscript is in its late stages, and hopefully youâ€™ll be able to take a look at it soon ðŸ¤ž

I again had the opportunity to participate in the [PLANTS program](https://botany.org/home/awards/travel-awards-for-students/plants-grants/plants.html), which has become one of my favorite parts of Botany. Weâ€™ve built such a supportive and inspiring community. My pod this year included me, Aidan Harrington from the University of Minnesota, and Tyler Radtke from the University of Florida. I also had the chance to reconnect with the near-peer mentor from my pod last year, Kandiss Dowdell from the University of California, Davis, and many other wonderful people from the program. Such an incredible initiative!!

Just wanted to share my gratitude to BSA, ASPT, the conference organizers, all the plant people, the PLANTS program, the Latvis lab, and all the new friends I made this year. Iâ€™m already looking forward to being part of it again next year in Tucson! ðŸŒ±
