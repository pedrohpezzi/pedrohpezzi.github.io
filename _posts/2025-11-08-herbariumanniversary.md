The [**UARK Herbarium**](https://biology.uark.edu/herbarium/) celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2025. We celebrated it with several events featuring art, music, science, and, of course, plants. We kicked things off with a dinner in a beautiful outdoor space, under the trees and surrounded by fall colors. The event included musical performances, artwork, and scientific talks.

We also held a research symposium with talks from students and faculty from across Arkansas, as well as posters from UARK graduate students and me. My poster showed a bit of how herbarium collections are important genomic resources and how we’re using them to study the evolutionary history of the genus *Agalinis*.

On Saturday morning, graduate student Jenna Miladin organized the **Press to Preserve** event at the Fayetteville Public Library. It was open to the public and taught, hands-on, how to press plants and mount herbarium specimens (with help from grad student Morgan Russell). I was very happy to be part of this event and to celebrate such an important milestone for the herbarium. Here’s to many more years! 🥂 ✨ 🪴 🌻
