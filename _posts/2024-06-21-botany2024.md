I had the chance to attend the BOTANY conference **in person** for the first time! It was so much funâ€”I met amazing people, gave my first talk at a conference, and learned so much about the cool science everyone is doing. I was also lucky enough to be part of the [PLANTS program](https://cms.botany.org/home/awards/travel-awards-for-students/plants-grants.html#:~:text=The%20PLANTS%20program%20seeks%20to,botanical%20interests%2C%20and%20career%20goals.), where I got to share experiences with Elizabeth Mandala and Kandiss Dowdell. Big thanks to everyone in the Latvis lab for the company, as well as to the BSA, the PLANTS program, and everyone who made this experience so enjoyable! This was also my first time in Michigan, and we got to see a beautiful sunset at the beach (the water was cold, but it was so worth it!).
