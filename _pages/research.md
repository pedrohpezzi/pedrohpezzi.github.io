## Diversification of South American *Agalinis*

For my postdoc, [Dr. Maribeth Latvis](https://maribethlatvis.wixsite.com/plantsyst) and I will focus on *Agalinis* (Orobanchaceae). This genus displays an intriguing biogeographic history: it migrated from North America to South America, where it rapidly diversified, in the Andes and in Brazil. Additionally, all species are hemiparasitic, which makes them a super interesting system! We are right now investigating the biogeographic history of the group and investigating the role of pollination syndrome and life history transitions in the diversifciation of the group. We are also generating a high-quality reference genome for the group and conducted fieldwork in Brazil in 2025 to sample species from campos rupestres! Cool projects are on the way so stay tuned ☺️

## Hybridization and Diversification of *Petunia*

During my Ph.D., under the guidance of [Dr. Loreta Brandão de Freitas](http://lattes.cnpq.br/2802663347194050), my research focused on the effects of interspecific hybridization on the diversification of *Petunia*. It has become clear that hybridization plays a significant role in plant evolution, and *Petunia* provides a unique opportunity to understand how this phenomenon has impacted the diversification of a characteristic and charismatic group in the southern South American grasslands. In my [dissertation](/files/PezziDissertation2023.pdf), we used genomic, morphological, and geographical data to understand the adaptive radiation process of the group, the weak reproductive barriers between species, and both past and ongoing hybridization events. I had the opportunity to work on part of my Ph.D. with [Dr. Stacey Smith](https://www.colorado.edu/smithlab/) at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I used transcriptomic data to understand the evolutionary process of *Petunia* and its related genera, *Calibrachoa* and *Fabiana*, taking into account gene flow between different species.
