## Diversification of South American *Agalinis*

For my postdoc, [Dr. Maribeth Latvis](https://maribethlatvis.wixsite.com/plantsyst) and I will focus on *Agalinis* (Orobanchaceae). This genus displays an intriguing biogeographic history: it migrated from North America to South America, where it experienced rapid radiation, in the Andean region and in Brazil. Additionally, all species are hemiparasitic, which makes them a super interesting system! We intend to investigate species' evolutionary relationships, the evolution of the hummingbird pollination syndrome, and interspecific hybridization. This project is still in its initial phase, so stay tuned for updates on this!

## Hybridization and Diversification of *Petunia*

During my Ph.D., under the guidance of [Dr. Loreta Brandão de Freitas](http://lattes.cnpq.br/2802663347194050), my research focused on the effects of interspecific hybridization on the diversification of *Petunia*. It has become clear that hybridization plays a significant role in plant evolution, and *Petunia* provides a unique opportunity to understand how this phenomenon has impacted the diversification of a characteristic and charismatic group in the southern South American grasslands. My [dissertation](/files/PezziDissertation2023.pdf) comprised five chapters, where we used genomic, morphological, and geographical data to understand the adaptive radiation process of the group, the weak reproductive barriers between species, and both past and ongoing hybridization events. I had the opportunity to work on part of my Ph.D. with [Dr. Stacey Smith](https://www.colorado.edu/smithlab/) at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I used transcriptomic data to understand the evolutionary process of *Petunia* and its related genera, *Calibrachoa* and *Fabiana*, taking into account gene flow between different species.

## Chromosomal evolution within the *Petunia*-*Calibrachoa*-*Fabiana* clade

I was honored to receive the [Godfrey Hewitt Mobility Award](https://eseb.org/prizes-funding/godfrey-hewitt-mobility-award/) in 2023 to investigate the chromosome evolution of *Petunia*, *Calibrachoa*, and *Fabiana*. While the basic chromosome numbers for each genus are known, the project's primary objective was to investigate how these numbers have changed over time. Additionally, we aimed to provide valuable insights into the clade's evolutionary history, establishing connections to the speciation process, current hybridization capabilities, and the development of ancient reproductive barriers. This research was carried out in collaboration with [Dr. Rocio Deanna](https://rociodeanna.weebly.com/) and [Dr. Juan D. Urdampilleta](https://imbiv.conicet.unc.edu.ar/integrantes/investigadores-2/u/urdampilleta-juan-domingo/), both affiliated with CONICET-UNC in Argentina.
