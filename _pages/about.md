I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in Maribeth Latvis' lab at the University of Arkansas, where we are investigating the evolutionary history of South American species of the genus *Agalinis*.

I am originally from Brazil and grew up in Caxias do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, the southernmost state in Brazil. Later, I moved to Porto Alegre (in the same state) to study Biology at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), where I earned a teaching degree in 2018 and a bachelor's degree in 2019. Also in 2019, I joined Dr. Loreta Freitas' lab at the same university for my Ph.D., where I explored the role of hybridization in the diversification of *Petunia* species.

My research interests include phylogenomics, plant evolution, hybridization, and population genetics. Outside of academia, I enjoy reading thrillers and mysteries, listening to pop music, swimming, board games and exploring new places around the world.
